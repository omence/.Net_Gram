What is the purpose of the program?

The purpose of the application is to allow the user to add, edit and delete photos.

How do I run the program?

Select add a gram and then upload you picute, add your name and a caption and hit submit.

I have created a new Web Application, completed the Schema for the Database, made the classes for the schema, migrated the design, created the database added a basic user interface with full CRUD abilities.



Tools used, C#, ASP.NET Core, SystemIO, Bootstrap, and a shared HTML Layout.

The user will land on the home page, where they have the option to manage any of the options shown in the nav bar.
